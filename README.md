## Methodology
Convolutional Neural Networks are normally evolved at the value of a set source and scaled up to archive higher accuracy over the distinctive lengths of sources available. Normally, a distinctive version is turned into some model to get higher accuracy over the distinctive length of data. For example, ResNet may be scaled up from ResNet-18 to ResNet-200 by increasing the number of layers. Likewise, EfficientnetB0 is an enormously powerful compound coefficient to scaled-up CNNs in a greater structural manner. Unlike traditional strategies that arbitrarily scale community dimensions, consisting of width, intensity and resolution, this model uniformly scales every size with a hard and fast set of scaling coefficients. Powered with the aid of using this novel scaling technique, which surpasses contemporary accuracy with as much as 10x higher efficiency (smaller and faster). The first step withinside the compound scaling technique is to carry out a grid search to locate the connection among unique scaling dimensions of the baseline community below a set of useful resource constraints. This determines the right scaling coefficient for every size stated above. The effectiveness of version scaling additionally is predicated closely on the baseline network. So, to similarly enhance performance, weâ€™ve advanced a brand new baseline community with the aid of using appearing a neural architecture search with the usage of the AutoML MNAS framework, which optimizes each accuracy and efficiency (FLOPS). The ensuing structure makes use of cellular inverted bottleneck convolution (MBConv), much like MobileNetV2 and MnasNet, however, is barely large because of a multiplied FLOP budget. We then scale up the baseline community to acquire our own circle of relatives of models, known as EfficientNets.
